##January
This inagural month features a "maze" theme.  Submit a brief proposal by Friday, Jan 9th, with a "Shift + Ship It" date of Saturday, Jan 31st.  Good luck.
###Proposals:

####Andy
I propose to build a maze game where a ping pong ball has to be paddled through a procedurally-generated maze.  At each corner, the player must hit an arrow key to strike the ball in a direction.  Or maybe the player has to place ping pong players and/or paddles throughout the maze, and then use them to hit the ball.

####Michael
What if you were trying to guide a ball in a 2D maze, but gravity was involved? And maybe the ball is bouncy? And maybe you can rotate the board (to change the direction that gavity is pulling the ball)? I make no promises that this game will be any fun.

####Jason
Mouse + cheese &trade;

A Tron-bike like game (single player). The moto will steer in arcs and not with the classic 90deg pattern. Also walls will randomly appear from time to time.
